GADGET-4-CPPC
========

![](documentation/img/top.jpg)

GADGET-4-CPPC is an N-body code to study neutrinos and any hot dark matter 
with linear response, multifluid and hybrid methods. It is based on the code 
GADGET-4, that is a massively parallel code for N-body/hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations and mainly written by Volker Springel.

Most of the implementations have been performed by Joe Chen, and a previous version of the 
code can be found in [gadget4-hybrid_public](https://github.com/joechenUNSW/gadget4-hybrid_public)
